There are some things you can't cover up with chain mail and shouting<br>
But I heard you mention my sword--can't you talk any louder?<br>
Don't come any closer -- don't come any nearer<br>
Your insults of me can't get any clearer<br>
Oh, I just wanna hear guards talk<br>
Loaded down with armor being judged by guards's talk<br>
But I can't say the words you wanna hear<br>
I suppose you're gonna have to take that arrow in the knee, right here<br>
(Guards talk) and they wanna know how<br>
(Guards talk) and they say it's not allowed<br>
(Guards talk)<br>
If they say that it's so, don't you think that I'd know by now?

A [Keyword Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) mod to assign [Guard Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22075) keywords to as many modded armors and weapons as I can think of. It's a single file full of keyword distribution declarations. KID does all the hard work.

Why? Because GDO is fun, and it's more fun when they also react to the weapon you took all that trouble to do the quest for / craft / find in an out-of-the-way spot.

## Mods currently covered

Keywords are distributed to editor ids for all items where possible, so distribution succeeds with items in collections with different form ids, and items in compacted and ESL-ified plugin files. If a weapon from a larger set does not fit into the categories covered by the GDO keywords, I do not add any keywords to it.

The mod is fine to enable even if you don't have all these mods installed.
