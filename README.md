# Guards Talk

A [Keyword Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) mod to assign [Guard Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22075) keywords to as many modded armors and weapons as I can think of. It's a single file full of keyword distribution declarations. KID does all the work.

See the [nexus description document](./nexus_docs.md) for a list of mods covered thus far. Why this list? Because those are enabled in my current load order.
