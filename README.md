# Guards Talk

There are some things you can't cover up<br>
with chain mail and shouting<br>
but I heard you mention my sword<br>
can't you talk any louder?<br>
don't come any closer<br>
don't come any nearer<br>
my vision of you can't get any clearer<br>
(guards talk)<br>
and they want to know how (guards talk)<br>
and they think it's not allowed (guards talk)<br>

A [Keyword Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) mod to assign [Guard Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22075) keywords to as many modded armors and weapons as I can think of. It's a single file full of keyword distribution declarations. KID does all the work.
